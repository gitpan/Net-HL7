1.0 Description
---------------

This is the Perl HL7 API. It is a very simple, but rather flexible API
for use in Perl applications.  Development is in full progress, so
please bear with me for the moment, while I test the API in real
situations, and converge on a basic API that provides the stuff you
meet in real HL7-life.


2.0 History
-----------
version 0.64:
* Fixed error in daemon and ack tests
* Fixed erroneous setting of MSH fields in Message.pm
* set MSH(11) to P and MSH(15) to AL per default
* Made new() method of Message also split message string on \n
* ACK now takes MSH(11) and MSH(12) from incoming MSH, and sets MSH(15) and MSH(16)
  to the empty string.
* Fixed erroneous sendAck and sendNack methods. The stuff is now sent as a single 
  line, to prevent perl from inserting separators, like end of lines, etc.

version 0.63:
* fixed some POD errors
* added the sendResponse method to Net::HL7::Daemon::Client
* Removed NACK module: it doesn't exists in the HL7 world.
* The MSH segment now uses index 1 of it's fields for the FIELD_SEPARATOR value;
  other fields have moved one to the right
* added setAckCode method to ACK, to be able to set the error for the acknowledgement.

version 0.62:
* Fixed erroneous read of input buffer for Client
* Added ACK, NACK messages
* Added MSH segment
* getSegmentByName is removed
* Made the Daemon and the Client inherit from IO::Socket, so you can more 
  easy do things with forking and other server operations you would 
  perform on sockets.
* Made several constructors set segments and values, like auto-adding the
  MSH segment to every instance of Message.

version 0.61:
* Moved the stuff to a new namespace (Net::HL7)
* Created a Daemon, resembling the HTTP::Daemon
* Created the Request and Response classes
* added tests

version 0.5:
* Added the getField method to HL7::Message
* repaired broken message parse for HL7::Message constructor

version 0.4:
* Removed spurious newline between segments.
