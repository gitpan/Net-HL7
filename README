1.0 Description
---------------

This is the Perl HL7 API. It is a very simple, but rather flexible API
for use in Perl applications.  Development is in full progress, so
please bear with me for the moment, while I test the API in real
situations, and converge on a basic API that provides the stuff you
meet in real HL7-life.


2.0 History
-----------
version 0.62:
* Fixed erroneous read of input buffer for Client
* Added ACK, NACK messages
* Added MSH segment
* getSegmentByName is removed
* Made the Daemon and the Client inherit from IO::Socket, so you can more 
  easy do things with forking and other server operations you would 
  perform on sockets.
* Made several constructors set segments and values, like auto-adding the
  MSH segment to every instance of Message.

version 0.61:
* Moved the stuff to a new namespace (Net::HL7)
* Created a Daemon, resembling the HTTP::Daemon
* Created the Request and Response classes
* added tests

version 0.5:
* Added the getField method to HL7::Message
* repaired broken message parse for HL7::Message constructor

version 0.4:
* Removed spurious newline between segments.
